Union find Problem :
-----------------------------

Given a set of N objects.

    ・Union command: connect two objects.
    ・Find/connected query: is there a path connecting the two objects?

Applications:

    ・Percolation.
    ・Games (Go, Hex).
    ・Dynamic connectivity.
    ・Least common ancestor.
    ・Equivalence of finite state automata.
    ・Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm in physics.
    ・Hinley-Milner polymorphic type inference.
    ・Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
    ・Compiling equivalence statements in Fortran.
    ・Morphological attribute openings and closings.
    ・Matlab's bwlabel() function in image processing.

Implementation :
    Find query. Check if two objects are in the same component.
    Union command. Replace components containing two objects with their union.

Algorithms :

    1. Quick find ( Eigen approach ):
            Find: Check if p and q have the same id.
            Union :  To merge components containing p and q, change all entries whose id equals id[p] to id[q]

    2. Quick Union (Lazy approach ):
     It uses the same data structure or array ID with size M but now it has a different interpretation.
     the array now represents a set of trees that's called a forest

            Find: Check if p and q have the same root.
            Union: To merge components containing p and q,set the id of p's root to the id of q's root.
